                <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[1] Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas [2] The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph [3] ``There is no need for alarm,&#x27;&#x27; Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday [4] Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely follow Gilbert&#x27;s movement [5] An estimated 100,000 people live in the province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles west of Santo Domingo [6] Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night [7] The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a [8] m [9] Sunday at latitude 16 [10] 1 north, longitude 67 [11] 5 west, about 140 miles south of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo [12] The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area of cloudiness and heavy weather&#x27;&#x27; rotating around the center of the storm [13] The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p [14] m [15] Sunday [16] Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto Rico&#x27;s south coast [17] There were no reports of casualties [18] San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts Saturday, but they subsided during the night [19] On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U [20] S [21] Gulf Coast [22] Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain [23] Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm season, was the second hurricane [24] The first, Debby, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last month [25] Hurricane Gilbert, packing 110 mph winds and torrential rain, moved over this capital city today after skirting Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic [26] There were no immediate reports of casualties [27] Telephone communications were affected [28] ``Right now it&#x27;s actually moving over Jamaica,&#x27;&#x27; said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami [29] ``We&#x27;ve already had reports of 110 mph winds on the eastern tip [30] ``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they&#x27;re going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane,&#x27;&#x27; Sheets said [31] Forecasters say Gilbert was expected to lash Jamaica throughout the day and was on track to later strike the Cayman Islands, a small British dependency northwest of Jamaica [32] Meanwhile, Havana Radio reported today that 25,000 people were evacuated from Guantanamo Province on Cuba&#x27;s southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from Gilbert began brushing the island [33] All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport, while flights from Grand Cayman, the main island of the three-island chain, arrived packed with frightened travelers [34] ``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman) like chickens with their heads cut off,&#x27;&#x27; said one vacationer who was returning home to California through Miami [35] Hurricane warnings were posted for the Cayman Islands, Cuba and Haiti [36] Warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic [37] ``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,&#x27;&#x27; the service said, adding, ``Little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over Jamaica&#x27;&#x27; [38] The Associated Press&#x27; Caribbean headquarters in San Juan, Puerto Rico, was unable to get phone calls through to Kingston, where high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches [39] Most Jamaicans stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane [40] Some companies broadcast appeals for technicians and electricians to report to work [41] The weather bureau predicted Gilbert&#x27;s center, 140 miles southeast of Kingston before dawn, would pass south of Kingston and hit the southern parish of Clarendon [42] Flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of Portland on the northeast and St [43] Mary on the north [44] The north coast tourist region from Montego Bay on the west and Ocho Rios on the east, far from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains, was expected only to receive heavy rain [45] Officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the south coast to seek higher ground [46] ``It&#x27;s certainly one of the larger systems we&#x27;ve seen in the Caribbean for a long time,&#x27;&#x27; said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center [47] Forecasters at the center said the eye of Gilbert was 140 miles southeast of Kingston at dawn today [48] Maximum sustained winds were near 110 mph, with tropical-storm force winds extending up to 250 miles to the north and 100 miles to the south [49] Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica alerted all government agencies, saying Sunday night: ``Hurricane Gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the Office of Disaster Preparedness in order to minimize the danger&#x27;&#x27; [50] Forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it passed over the ocean after it dumped 5 to 10 inches of rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of Hispaniola [51] ``We should know within about 72 hours whether it&#x27;s going to be a major threat to the United States,&#x27;&#x27; said Martin Nelson, another meteorologist at the center [52] ``It&#x27;s moving at about 17 mph to the west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass central Cuba&#x27;&#x27; [53] Cuba&#x27;s official Prensa Latina news agency said a state of alert was declared at midday in the Cuban provinces of Guantanamo, Holguin, Santiago de Cuba and Granma [54] In the report from Havana received in Mexico City, Prensa Latina said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on national radio and television recommending emergency measures and providing information on the storm [55] Heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the Dominican Republic on Sunday night as the hurricane&#x27;s center passed just south of the Barahona peninsula, then less than 100 miles from neighboring Haiti [56] The storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas of southwestern Puerto Rico after reaching hurricane strength off the island&#x27;s southeast Saturday night [57] Flights were canceled Sunday in the Dominican Republic, where civil defense director Eugenio Cabral reported some flooding in parts of the capital of Santo Domingo and power outages there and in other southern areas [58] Hurricane Gilbert slammed into Kingston on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines [59] No serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of 750,000 people, which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon [60] For half an hour, the hurricane lashed the city, tearing branches from trees, blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air [61] The National Weather Service reported heavy damage to Kingston&#x27;s airport and aircraft parked on its fields [62] The first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the city [63] Skies brightened, the winds died down and people waited for an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived [64] All Jamaica-bound flights were canceled at Miami International Airport [65] Flights from the Cayman Islands, reportedly next in the path of the hurricane, arrived in Miami packed with travelers cutting short their vacations [66] ``People were running around in the main lobby of our hotel (on Grand Cayman Island) like chickens with their heads cut off,&#x27;&#x27; said one man [67] A National Weather Service report said the hurricane was moving west at 17 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph [68] It said Jamaica would receive up to 10 inches of rain that would cause flash floods and mud slides [69] ``Right now it&#x27;s actually moving over Jamaica,&#x27;&#x27; said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami [70] ``It looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island, and they&#x27;re going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane,&#x27;&#x27; he said [71] Gilbert reached Jamaica after skirting southern Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic [72] Hurricane warnings were issued Monday for the south coast of Cuba east of Camaguey, the Cayman Islands, and Haiti, while warnings were discontinued for the Dominican Republic [73] High winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched Kingston overnight, toppling trees, causing local flooding and littering streets with branches [74] Most of Jamaica&#x27;s 2 [75] 3 million people stayed home, boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane [76] The popular north coast resort area, on the other side of the mountains, was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much damage from the hurricane as the south coast, where officials urged residents to seek higher ground [77] Havana Radio, meanwhile, reported Monday that 25,000 people were evacuated from coastal areas in Guantanamo Province on the nation&#x27;s southeastern coast as Gilbert&#x27;s winds and rain began to brush the island [78] In Washington, the Navy reported its bases at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane [79] Lt [80] Ken Ross, a spokesman, said the Navy station at Guantanamo reported that as of 2:30 p [81] m [82] EDT, the brunt of the storm appeared to be passing southeastern Cuba [83] ``They have reported maximum winds of 25 knots and gusts up to 50 knots,&#x27;&#x27; said Ross [84] ``But there are no reports of injuries or damage&#x27;&#x27; [85] The spokesman said earlier in the day, Guantanamo had moved to ``Condition Two,&#x27;&#x27; meaning electrical power usage was cut back to only essential uses and ``all non-essential personnel sent to their barracks&#x27;&#x27; [86] The storm also skirted Puerto Rico without causing any damage to military facilities, Ross said [87] Sheets said Gilbert was expected next to sweep over the Cayman Islands, on its westward track, and in two to three days veer northwest into the southern Gulf of Mexico [88] Residents of the neighboring Caymans, a British dependency to the northwest, were urged to ``rush all preparatory actions&#x27;&#x27; [89] The National Weather Service warned that the Caymans could expect high waters and large waves ``which may undermine buildings along the beaches&#x27;&#x27; [90] ``All interests in the Western Caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane,&#x27;&#x27; the service advised [91] Forecaster Hal Gerrish on Sunday described Gilbert ``certainly one of the larger systems we&#x27;ve seen in the Caribbean for a long time [92] &#x27;&#x27; Hurricane Gilbert, one of the strongest storms ever, slammed into the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday and leveled thatched homes, tore off roofs, uprooted trees and cut off the Caribbean resorts of Cancun and Cozumel [93] Looters roamed the streets of Cancun, stealing from stores whose windows were blown away [94] Huge waves battered the beach resorts and thousands were evacuated [95] Despite the intensity of the onslaught and the ensuing heavy flooding, officials reported only two minor injuries [96] The storm killed 19 people in Jamaica and five in the Dominican Republic before moving west to Mexico [97] Prime Minister Edward Seaga of Jamaica said Wednesday the storm destroyed an estimated 100,000 of Jamaica&#x27;s 500,000 homes when it throttled the island Monday [98] The Jamaican Embassy reported earlier that 500,000 of the nation&#x27;s 2 [99] 3 million people were homeless [100] In Cancun, amateur radio operators said an oil tanker from the fleet of the government oil monopoly Pemex, the Lazaro Cardenas, had run aground on the beach in the Cancun hotel zone [101] Pemex officials however said all their vessels were secure [102] Army officials in Mexico City said about 35,000 people were evacuated from Cancun, but Cancun Mayor Jose Sanchez Zapata said about 11,000 fled [103] More than 120,000 people on the northeast Yucatan coast were evacuated, the Yucatan state government said [104] The eye of the storm passed over Cozumel and Cancun with howling winds clocked at 160 mph at about 8 a [105] m [106] EDT [107] The winds bent and toppled utility poles and uprooted slum dwellings [108] Ham radio operators around Cancun said Gilbert knocked down a radio and television communications tower, uprooted trees and blew the roofs off buildings [109] Floods prevented officials from reaching the hotel zone in Cancun and there were no relief efforts under way by late Wednesday [110] Shelters had little or no food, water or blankets and power was out [111] ``We can&#x27;t do it yet [112] The wind would blow them away,&#x27;&#x27; said an army official at city hall who declined to give his name [113] Bands of 25-30 youths roamed the streets of Cancun Wednesday, looting stores with shattered windows, said Alfredo Moro Sanchez, investigative coordinator of the Quintana Roo state judicial police [114] He said he asked for army troops to halt the looting but none had arrived by late Wednesday [115] About 150 tourists took refuge at the Cancun city hall [116] Honeymooner Sheila Fournier of Long Island said she and her husband, Pete, had been evacuated from the Villas Playa Hotel [117] ``It had an ocean-front view _ which is now washed away,&#x27;&#x27; she said [118] Officials were checking low-lying areas of Cancun for stranded residents [119] There was heavy damage visible to the humble wood and thatch homes typical of the Yucatan [120] ``There were some people who did not want to leave yesterday,&#x27;&#x27; the army official said [121] ``It was something new [122] They didn&#x27;t know what a cyclone was&#x27;&#x27; [123] At midnight EDT Gilbert was centered near latitude 21 [124] 5 north, longitude 90 [125] 2 west and approaching the north coast of Yucatan, about 60 miles east-northeast of the provincial capital, Merida, the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla [126] , said [127] The storm was about 550 miles southeast of Brownsville, Texas, the center said in a statement [128] Gilbert was moving west-northwest at 15 mph and winds had decreased to 125 mph [129] The Mexican National Weather Service reported winds gusting as high as 218 mph earlier Wednesday with sustained winds of 179 mph [130] Earlier Wednesday Gilbert was classified as a Category 5 storm, the strongest ad deadliest type of hurricane [131] Such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than 155 mph and can cause catastrophic damage [132] By Wednesday night the National Hurricane Center downgraded it to a Category 4, but center director Bob Sheets said:``There&#x27;s no question it&#x27;ll strengthen again once it comes off the Yucatan Peninsula and gets back in open water&#x27;&#x27; [133] As Gilbert moved away from the Yucatan Peninsula Wednesday night, the hurricane formed a double eye, two concentric circles of thunderstorms often characteristic of a strong storm that has crossed land and is moving over the water again [134] One eye was about eight miles wide, and the second about 25 miles wide, said hurricane center meteorologist Jesse Moore [135] ``This is one of the features that we expected to see as the hurricane moved back over the water, and we do expect intensification,&#x27;&#x27; he said [136] Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969, killing 256 people [137] Oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the Gulf of Mexico [138] The peninsula ports of Campeche, Celestum, Progreso, Sinzal, Ucaltepen, Tel-Chac, Cancun, Puerto Morelos, and Ciudad del Carmen were closed, the government news agency Notimex said [139] Airports in the region were closed [140] ``The sound of the wind outside is horrible,&#x27;&#x27; said receptionist Pablo Torres at Cancun&#x27;s Hotel Carrillos as the storm approached [141] The National Hurricane Center said a hurricane watch was in effect on the Texas coast from Brownsville to Port Arthur and along the coast of northeast Mexico from Tampico north [142] In Mexico City, the National Civil Defense System said it lost telephone contact with Cancun and Cozumel at about 8 a [143] m [144] EDT [145] Public buildings in Cancun were used as shelters, said Cecila Lavalle, a spokesman for Quintana Roo state government in Chetumal, 155 miles southeast of Cozumel [146] Jennie Valdez, a U [147] S [148] consular representative in Cancun, said she did not know how many tourists were in Cancun, but government figures estimate 40,000 to 65,000 monthly visitors [149] Hurricane warnings were in effect for the entire Yucatan Peninsula and widespread evacuations were reported [150] Winds destroyed at least 100 homes in slums of Valladolid, a town of about 45,000 about 100 miles from Cozumel, Alberto Pol, a judicial police officer, said by telephone [151] The National Hurricane Center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure [152] It was measured at 26 [153] 31 inches, breaking the 26 [154] 35 inches recorded for the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys [155] ``That&#x27;s the lowest pressure ever measured in the Western Hemisphere,&#x27;&#x27; said forecaster Mark Zimmer [156] On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, Gilbert pounded the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands [157] Seaga said Jamaica would need $8 billion in aid [158] Officials in the Dominican Republic, sideswiped Sunday by the storm, reported five dead [159] Gilbert also buffeted the Cayman Islands, but no deaths were reported [160] Hurricane Gilbert&#x27;s growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters [161] ``It&#x27;s a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time,&#x27;&#x27; Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday [162] ``It doesn&#x27;t happen very often [163] How it develops, we don&#x27;t know&#x27;&#x27; [164] Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept [165] 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa [166] ``We get 50 or 60 of these off Africa every summer [167] About one of six develop,&#x27;&#x27; said Clark [168] By Sept [169] 8, the system became a depression [170] It reached tropical storm status by Saturday and a hurricane Sunday [171] A tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling [172] When sustained winds reach 39 mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm [173] It reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74 mph [174] Why Gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didn&#x27;t ``is a mystery more or less,&#x27;&#x27; said University of Miami meteorology Professor Rainer Bleck [175] ``The first part of the summer we were biting our nails, wondering why these (other) disturbances didn&#x27;t develop,&#x27;&#x27; he said Thursday [176] ``That&#x27;s something meteorologists would like to know more about&#x27;&#x27; [177] But the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins [178] And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place [179] ``If that happens in an area where there&#x27;s plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation,&#x27;&#x27; Bleck said [180] ``If clouds form, the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides `positive feedback&#x27; to the convergence pattern [181] That strengthens it,&#x27;&#x27; he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earth&#x27;s rotation [182] Eventually, a vortex is created [183] ``Any time you contract an air mass, they will start spinning [184] That&#x27;s what makes the tornadoes, hurricanes and blizzards, those winter storms,&#x27;&#x27; Bleck said [185] Hurricanes ``are useful to the climate machine [186] Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere,&#x27;&#x27; he said [187] ``The sun puts energy into the water, the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere [188] That has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere&#x27;&#x27; [189] When the depression that would become Gilbert neared Barbados, warm Atlantic waters nurtured it [190] ``This time of year in the northwest Caribbean is best for development,&#x27;&#x27; Clark said [191] ``If you get a storm in this area in September, when the water&#x27;s warmest, it can just explode [192] This is where Camille formed and exploded,&#x27;&#x27; referring to the 1969 storm that slammed into the Gulf Coast [193] ``It is an exciting thing to watch [194] If you&#x27;re on the beach watching the storm surge, it&#x27;s a different story,&#x27;&#x27; he said [195] The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure, measured at 26 [196] 13 inches Tuesday night [197] That broke the 26 [198] 35 inches of the 1935 hurricane that devastated the Florida Keys [199] Hurricane Gilbert swept toward Jamaica yesterday with 100-mile-an-hour winds, and officials issued warnings to residents on the southern coasts of the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Cuba [200] The storm ripped the roofs off houses and caused coastal flooding in Puerto Rico [201] In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled [202] Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west [203] &quot;It&#x27;s still gaining strength [204] It&#x27;s certainly one of the larger systems we&#x27;ve seen in the Caribbean for a long time,&quot; said Hal Gerrish, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla [205] At 3 p [206] m [207] EDT, the center of the hurricane was about 100 miles south of the Dominican Republic and 425 miles east of Kingston, Jamaica [208] The hurricane was moving west at about 15 mph and was expected to continue this motion for the next 24 hours [209] Forecasters said the hurricane&#x27;s track would take it about 50 miles south of southwestern Haiti [210] The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain in port until conditions improve [211] The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight [212] Hurricane warnings were issued for the south coast of Haiti and Cuba by their respective governments [213] In Jamaica, the government issued a hurricane watch for the entire island [214] Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night [215] In Puerto Rico, besides tearing off several roofs, the storm caused coastal flooding and brought down power lines and trees along roads and highways in the west and southwestern regions [216] Three people were injured in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, when a tree fell on their vehicle as they traveled along Route 97, police reported [217] Four policemen stationed on Mona Island, between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, were stranded as a result of the weather</pre>
