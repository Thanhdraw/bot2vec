                <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[1] An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to collapse and killing eight people, officials said [2] Thirty people were injured and up to 18 were missing and feared trapped in the rubble [3] The blast occurred at at 8:26 a [4] m [5] in a lounge in the barracks near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministry said [6] ``The building has collapsed,&#x27;&#x27; said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom [7] ``We&#x27;ve no idea of the cause of the blast at the moment [8] It is too early to tell&#x27;&#x27; [9] Scotland Yard said a forensic team from its anti-terrorist squad had been called in to help investigate [10] Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons [11] Kent police said 17 or 18 people were trapped [12] The Defense Ministry said seven were missing [13] Ten doctors gave emergency treatment at the scene and 11 ambulances took the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service said [14] ``They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms, fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after an explosion,&#x27;&#x27; said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20 miles south of Deal [15] South Eastern British Gas sent investigators to the scene but said there was nothing to indicate the explosion was caused by a gas leak [16] Gas supplies to the barracks were cut as a precautionary measure, a spokesman said [17] Guy Platts, who owns a bookstore in Deal, located 20 miles north of the English Channel port of Dover, said he heard a ``massive explosion [18] There are dozens of ambulances, police and fire brigade making their way there&#x27;&#x27; [19] Military targets on the British mainland have been attacked several times by the Irish Republican Army in the past year as part of its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule [20] One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988 [21] About 60 soldiers narrowly escaped death or injury in February when they were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded [22] In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks at Knightsbridge in central London and at a bandstand in the capital&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park where an army band was playing [23] Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings [24] Neighbors were breakfasting, heading to work or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned their homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of bodies being carried away [25] ``There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz [26] After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me,&#x27;&#x27; said Joan Betteridge, a pensioner in the southern England town of Deal, where the blast at the Royal Marines School of Music occurred [27] The Irish Republican Army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion, which police said killed 11 people and injured 22 [28] Nearby resident Sean Minnock said: ``I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt [29] the bedroom ceiling fell in on me [30] I woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor&#x27;&#x27; [31] From the wrecked, smoke-clouded barracks, ``I could hear terrified screams of agony [32] People started rushing about all over the place [33] It was horrible to watch and listen to,&#x27;&#x27; said Minnock, 28 [34] ``I knew people had been seriously hurt [35] I saw the rescuers pull out two bodies [36] I knew they were dead when they put them on the floor and put bed blankets right over them&#x27;&#x27; [37] Minnock&#x27;s wife, Janet, said the roof of their house was torn off and all the back windows were shattered [38] ``The house has been blown to bits,&#x27;&#x27; she said [39] Mrs [40] Minnock was feeding her 2-year-old son Thomas his breakfast when the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the street backing onto the barracks [41] Her next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, 26, was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks, holding her 4-month-old son Luke in her arms [42] Her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, were at her side [43] ``I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,&#x27;&#x27; she said [44] ``I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a sliver of glass embedded itself in his back [45] ``The whole window was blown across the kitchen [46] I just screamed and ran out of the room [47] The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in [48] ``At first I thought for sure Joshua had been seriously injured [49] There was blood coming out of his back&#x27;&#x27; [50] Doctors removed the glass and sent him home [51] College student Simon Mitford, 17, narrowly escaped being injured in the explosion because he got up earlier than usual [52] ``His room was completely wrecked by the blast,&#x27;&#x27; his brother Alex said [53] Of the barracks, he said: ``I heard music playing and then it went bang and there was glass everywhere [54] It was a two-story building but now 90 percent of it is rubble [55] ``I heard a marine scream out, `The band is under there&#x27; [56] I was scared there was going to be a second explosion [57] &#x27;&#x27; An explosion today flattened a military barracks and tore through nearby homes, killing 11 people and injuring 22, police said [58] The IRA claimed responsibility for the blast [59] More than 100 rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a three-story building that collapsed at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal [60] Stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that were damaged or destroyed [61] Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who provided the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, first reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was accounted for [62] He said many of the injured were seriously hurt [63] ``There was a terrific crash which reminded me of the Blitz [64] After that, the ceiling started to fall down around me,&#x27;&#x27; said pensioner Joan Betteridge [65] Defense Secretary Tom King, inspecting the wreckage, said: ``It is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb, but all the evidence is quite clearly that this is an IRA atrocity&#x27;&#x27; [66] British military installations are a frequent bombing target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to rid Northern Ireland of British rule, but today&#x27;s explosion in the coastal town 70 miles southeast of London was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland in more than seven years [67] The explosion occurred at at 8:26 a [68] m [69] in a lounge in the barracks [70] One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom [71] Dozens of homes near the school were damaged, including four that were destroyed [72] Witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles away [73] The Defense Ministry would not say how many servicemen and civilians were included in the casualty figures [74] However, King told reporters the attack was directed against ``unarmed bandsmen&#x27;&#x27; [75] Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search through the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons [76] Ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and 11 ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service said [77] A statement telephoned to Ireland International, a Dublin news agency, said ``we have visited the Royal Marines in Kent&#x27;&#x27; in response to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s visit to Northern Ireland nine days ago [78] The IRA said Mrs [79] Thatcher went to the British province ``with a message of war,&#x27;&#x27; but ``we still want peace and we want the British government to leave our country&#x27;&#x27; [80] It was signed P [81] O&#x27;Neill, a nom de guerre the IRA usually uses to claim responsibility for actions outside Northern Ireland [82] Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey issued a statement in Dublin condemning the attack, calling it an ``outrage&#x27;&#x27; [83] The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded [84] One soldier was killed and nine wounded in an IRA bomb attack on an army barracks in north London in August 1988 [85] In July 1982, eight soldiers died in IRA bombings near the Household Cavalry barracks in central London and at a bandstand in the capital&#x27;s Regent&#x27;s Park where an army band was playing [86] Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings [87] The music school is the training center for young recruits who want to play in the seven Royal Marines bands [88] Up to 250 young men, most between 16 and 20, are based at the school, where they receive military and musical training [89] The roof of Janet Minnock&#x27;s house was torn off by the force of the blast and all the back windows were shattered [90] ``The house has been blown to bits,&#x27;&#x27; she said [91] ``We are all shaken up&#x27;&#x27; [92] Mrs [93] Minnock&#x27;s next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of the explosion [94] She was holding her 4-month-old son Luke in her arms with her other boys, Ben, 3, and Joshua, 2, at her side [95] ``I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,&#x27;&#x27; she said [96] ``I told the boys to run and as Joshua turned a slither of glass embedded itself in his back [97] The whole window was blown across the kitchen [98] I just screamed and ran out of the room [99] The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in&#x27;&#x27; [100] Sean Minnock said: ``I was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt&#x27;&#x27; [101] As workers tried to patch holes in his roof, he said: ``The bedroom ceiling fell in on me [102] I woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor [103] I wondered what it was [104] As soon as I got up I looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the barracks [105] &#x27;&#x27; The IRA bombing that killed 10 men and blew apart a building at the Royal Marines Music School outraged Britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school [106] A huge explosion in a barracks staff room Friday morning leveled the three-story building as bandsmen took a coffee break between practice sessions on the school&#x27;s parade ground [107] Twelve of the 22 people injured were hospitalized, eight of them in serious condition, police said [108] They said nine of the dead were bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified [109] Dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern English seaside town of Deal were damaged [110] Although trainees at the school range in age from 16 to 20, Col [111] John Ware, principal director of music, said the slain bandsmen all were trained, adult musicians [112] They held military ranks but none had been trained as a fighting soldier [113] The outlawed Irish Republican Army, engaged in a 20-year-old campaign to drive the British from the province of Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility in a telephone call to Ireland International, a Dublin news agency [114] Residents of the area adjoining the Marines school said Friday that despite government calls for stepped-up public alertness against terrorists, security at the school had eased noticeably [115] ``Anyone in Deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the base,&#x27;&#x27; said Fred Verge, a 70-year-old army veteran [116] Local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance to the barracks [117] ``There is a great sense of anger&#x27;&#x27; in the community, Kent police Chief Constable Paul Condon said [118] The Royal Marines Music School is one of 30 military establishments in Britain that use private security firms, Defense Ministry figures show [119] Unidentified defense sources quoted by the Times newspaper today said the civilian guards were backed up by armed Marines who patrolled regularly inside the perimeter [120] Defense Secretary Tom King promised a security review and said new measures had already been taken at the base [121] He did not elaborate [122] Martin O&#x27;Neill, the opposition Labor Party&#x27;s spokesman on defense, said on Friday: ``Serious questions must be asked about the penny-pinching policy of the Ministry of Defense, which may well put our armed services at dreadful risk&#x27;&#x27; [123] O&#x27;Neill later told British Broadcasting Corp [124] television the IRA was ``prepared to take out anybody [125] The cowardly nature of their attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat&#x27;&#x27; [126] He said private security firms were assigned to areas considered low risks for attacks [127] ``If we designate places as being low-risk categories, then it is likely they will be attacked, given the way that the IRA is forced to operate,&#x27;&#x27; O&#x27;Neill added [128] ``The big prizes are no longer available to them, so they&#x27;re picking off the ones which they regard [129] vulnerable&#x27;&#x27; [130] Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher received news of the bombing while aboard a jet over Siberia en route from Japan to Moscow [131] She called it a ``deeply serious outrage&#x27;&#x27; [132] King visited the scene soon after the explosion [133] ``I know that the people who committed it, the godfathers who sent them, actually know in their hearts that it is not going to make any difference; that it is just killing for the sake of killing,&#x27;&#x27; he said [134] The defense minister, anger clearly written on his face, said that rather than erode the will of the security forces, the attack ``redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot win&#x27;&#x27; [135] Prime Minister Charles Haughey of Ireland condemned the attack and sent Mrs [136] Thatcher a message of sympathy at ``this outrage [137] which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries&#x27;&#x27; [138] The mainly Roman Catholic IRA claim gave no details of the operation, but said it was a response to a ``message of war&#x27;&#x27; delivered by Mrs [139] Thatcher when she visited Northern Ireland nine days ago [140] It was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment as ``a very, very brave group of men&#x27;&#x27; who have lost 179 members in IRA attacks since 1970 [141] The mainly Protestant UDR is regarded by many Catholics as a sectarian force, and is at present under a cloud over allegations that some recruits leaked names, addresses and photos of IRA suspects to Protestant assassins [142] British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA campaign [143] Friday&#x27;s attack was the worst since July 1982 when 11 servicemen were fatally wounded in two bombings in central London [144] The music school trains young recruits for the seven Royal Marines bands [145] Up to 250 young men, most ages 16 to 20, undergo military and musical training there, working with older, professional bandsmen [146] Family members on Saturday grieved for their slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the Royal Marines Music School, where an IRA terrorist attack killed 10 military musicians [147] Jean Cleatheroe, whose son Andrew was killed, joined local residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of private security firms to protect the music school and 29 other military establishments in Britain [148] ``The security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal [149] We had seen it for ourselves [150] We have always said how easy it would be for anyone to get in [151] What could ordinary security men do to stop terrorists&#x27;&#x27; [152] she said [153] British military installations are a frequent target of the IRA&#x27;s campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland [154] Friday&#x27;s attack was the worst since July 1982, when 11 servicemen were fatally wounded in bombings in central London [155] Shocked residents of Deal gathered outside the barracks to lay flowers in tribute to the young men they called the ``Bandies&#x27;&#x27; [156] An 11-year-old Royal Marines cadet in full dress uniform marched to the barracks and smartly saluted the Royal Marines sign [157] ``I&#x27;m proud of my uniform and I&#x27;m proud of all the Marines I knew [158] I hate the people who did this to them,&#x27;&#x27; said Scott Roberts [159] Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual leader of the Church of England, visited the injured and said he was impressed ``by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat them&#x27;&#x27; [160] Runcie said one of the men&#x27;s main concerns was that their hands would heal properly so they could continue playing their musical instruments [161] Police investigating the attack were searching a nearby house that had been rented briefly by three men with Irish accents [162] ``We know when the men arrived and when they left,&#x27;&#x27; Cmdr [163] George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard&#x27;s anti-terrorist squad, said at a news conference [164] ``It appears the men left several days before the explosion&#x27;&#x27; [165] He said the house, which overlooks the barracks recreation center destroyed by the Friday morning blast, was rented by its English owners to three men for two to three weeks [166] There was no proof the house was an IRA hideout, the commander said [167] ``By virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and the men are Irish, we are very anxious to talk to them,&#x27;&#x27; he said [168] Explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were painstakingly examining the house Saturday, and Churchill-Coleman said they would continue for the next two or three days [169] Police said all 10 men killed during a coffee break between morning band practices were servicemen [170] Of 22 men injured, 12 remained hospitalized Saturday, five in serious condition [171] The Irish Republican Army on Friday claimed responsibility for the explosion, which also severely damaged several nearby houses [172] Police have not determined what caused the blast, but Churchill-Coleman said, ``It would seem to be some form of improvised device using high explosives&#x27;&#x27; [173] The IRA did not specify how it caused the blast [174] Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the ``senseless&#x27;&#x27; killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA bombing, and Britain&#x27;s defense secretary said he warned all military bases of the risk of similar attacks [175] Clergyman urged relatives and friends of dead and maimed musicians to forgive the bombers [176] ``Only forgiveness breaks the tie between the hater and the hated,&#x27;&#x27; the Rev [177] George Lings told mourners [178] The prince, husband of Queen Elizabeth II and captain general of the Royal Marines, visited injured men in the hospital and toured the severely damaged Royal Marines School of Music in Deal, southeast Britain [179] ``It will not help the IRA win anything,&#x27;&#x27; said Philip, who wore a Royal Marines tie [180] ``It is senseless [181] One simply wonders what sort of mentality can even contemplate such meaningless acts [182] It is appalling&#x27;&#x27; [183] He paid tribute to the 12 injured men, five of whom were critically wounded [184] The prince was accompanied by Viscountess Mountbatten, daughter of Lord Mountbatten, who was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat in 1979 [185] Mountbatten was India&#x27;s last viceroy and a cousin of the queen [186] British military installations are a frequent target of the Irish Republican Army in its campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland [187] Defense Secretary Tom King said Sunday he has issued an alert to all military installations to prevent other attacks [188] He would not give details [189] ``The perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and there is a risk of other attacks,&#x27;&#x27; King said [190] ``That is why we are taking a number of other steps&#x27;&#x27; [191] King defended the use of private security firms hired to guard the Deal school and 29 other ``low-risk&#x27;&#x27; military installations in Britain [192] Local residents and grieving relatives have said security was lax and should be turned back to the marines [193] King said the private firms will remain [194] ``It is important to remember that what we need in these cases are eyes and ears and observation,&#x27;&#x27; King said on British Broadcasting Corp [195] radio [196] ``Private security guards can be a very useful additional assistance [197] They also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their activity&#x27;&#x27; [198] At church services throughout the small port, clergymen urged mourners to pray for and forgive the bombers [199] The Rev [200] Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the 300-member congregation inside the barracks, ``if you can find room in your hearts [201] pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their violent and evil ways&#x27;&#x27; [202] Many cried as Howard read aloud the names of the 10 servicemen killed during a coffee break between band practices [203] It was the worst IRA attack on the British mainland since July 1982 [204] At nearby St [205] George&#x27;s Church, formerly the Royal Marines&#x27; church, Lings said, ``no one says forgiveness is easy; no one says the terrorist deserves forgiveness [206] ``But [207] forgive them, they not what they do [208] &#x27;&#x27; Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are ``monsters&#x27;&#x27; who will be found and punished [209] ``The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time,&#x27;&#x27; she said following a tour of the school&#x27;s wrecked barracks in Deal, southeast England [210] ``We lost 10 remarkable musicians, not fighting men, just because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic views,&#x27;&#x27; she said [211] ``They are very evil people, absolute monsters&#x27;&#x27; [212] Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the IRA, issued a statement disputing Mrs [213] Thatcher&#x27;s remarks, saying ``she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the conflict, its cause and the remedy&#x27;&#x27; [214] The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland [215] ``We want an end to all violent deaths arising out of the present relationship between our two countries,&#x27;&#x27; Adams said [216] ``We want a new peaceful relationship based on an acceptance and respect for our rights as a sovereign nation&#x27;&#x27; [217] After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in the hospital, Mrs [218] Thatcher pledged: ``The hunt for the bombers will be pursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication&#x27;&#x27; [219] Raymond Kendall, the secretary-general of the international police organization Interpol, pledged the organization&#x27;s full support in the hunt for those who blew up the school [220] ``I hope we will have a part to play in finding them,&#x27;&#x27; said Kendall after opening the International Police Exhibition and Conference in London [221] ``They are criminals of the worst sort and should be dealt with as such&#x27;&#x27; [222] Before landing in Deal, Mrs [223] Thatcher&#x27;s helicopter flew over the rubble that had been the band&#x27;s recreation center [224] The IRA claimed responsibility for the explosion, and police said they are looking for three men with Irish accents who rented a house overlooking the barracks [225] The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion Friday that reduced a three-story military barracks on the southeast coast of England to rubble, killing 10 people and injuring 22, eight seriously [226] It would be one of the outlawed IRA&#x27;s deadliest attacks on the main British island [227] Nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast, which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away [228] The musicians were between the ages of 16 and 20 as are most of the recruits in the school [229] A police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb [230] But he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the IRA [231] Security sources said they believe that at least two IRA &quot;active service&quot; units, each composed of four or five members, are operating in Britain and continental Europe [232] One member, known as the &quot;Jackal&quot; after the assassin in the Frederick Forsyth novel &quot;The Day of the Jackal,&quot; has been eluding the authorities for two years [233] He has been identified as Patrick Sheehy and has been linked to the IRA&#x27;s last successful mainland bombing attack -- on an army barracks at Mill Hill in August, 1988 [234] One soldier was killed in that incident [235] Sheehy and another wanted Irishman, John Conaghty, were linked to an IRA bomb factory in North London that the police stumbled upon last December while in pursuit of a car thief [236] A search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons, ammunition, 150 pounds of Semtex high explosive and a &quot;hit list&quot; of 100 British political figures and other officials headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher [237] Friday&#x27;s explosion occurred about 8:30 a [238] m [239] in a lounge at the Royal Marines School of Music near Deal, on the English Channel in the county of Kent [240] At the school are about 250 recruits who receive military and musical training before joining Royal Marines bands [241] The roof of the three-story barracks collapsed, trapping victims beneath the rubble [242] Firefighters used thermal cameras and dogs to search the debris for victims and survivors [243] Heavy lifting gear was brought to the scene from a nearby site where a tunnel is being built beneath the English Channel [244] Rescuers shouted for quiet as they used high-technology listening equipment in an effort to trace the sound of faint heartbeats [245] &quot;I looked up from the sink and I just saw the whole building explode,&quot; Heather Hackett, a 26-year-old Deal housewife, told the British Press Assn [246] She said she told her children to run for cover, but as they did, her kitchen window shattered [247] &quot;The whole window was blown across the kitchen,&quot; Hackett recalled [248] Her 2-year-old son, Joshua, was hit by a shard that embedded itself in his back but caused no serious injury [249] &quot;I just screamed and ran out of the room,&quot; she said [250] &quot;The bang was so loud I thought the whole house was coming in&quot; [251] &#x27;Appalling Outrage&#x27; Defense Secretary Tom King visited the scene and called the bombing &quot;an appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen -- people who worked for charity, who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country, right across the world [252] &quot;The real evil of these murders is that the people who commit them, the &#x27;godfathers&#x27; who send them to commit them, know that they will actually achieve nothing [253] Terrorism is not going to win [254] We shall find the people responsible for this outrage sooner or later, as we have already found some of those responsible for the earlier outrages, and they will be brought to justice&quot;
