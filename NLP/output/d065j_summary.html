                <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[1] Dan Quayle&#x27;s sister believes the Indiana senator won&#x27;t let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy [2] ``I don&#x27;t think it will be tough on the family,&#x27;&#x27; said Martha Saddler, Quayle&#x27;s sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind [3] ``Since he&#x27;s been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it [4] But he does it and loves it&#x27;&#x27; [5] The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president [6] Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life [7] Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis, married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period [8] ``One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit,&#x27;&#x27; said Indianapolis attorney William R [9] Neale, treasurer of Quayle&#x27;s 1986 re-election campaign [10] ``He&#x27;s the same nice guy he was in law school&#x27;&#x27; [11] Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s [12] Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind [13] , before going to work in the Indiana attorney general&#x27;s office in 1970 [14] Daniel F [15] Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said he doesn&#x27;t expect Quayle&#x27;s national candidacy to change him [16] ``I think his strength is he&#x27;ll remember who his friends are even after this,&#x27;&#x27; said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle&#x27;s 1986 campaign [17] Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington [18] ``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,&#x27;&#x27; said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute [19] ``It&#x27;s a beautiful family [20] I think they&#x27;ll be a real asset&#x27;&#x27; [21] The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne [22] When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in two groups _ the boys riding in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinne and her father visiting county fairs [23] ``The kids are nonchalant, normal kids,&#x27;&#x27; said Mrs [24] Saddler [25] ``They take it in stride and play&#x27;&#x27; [26] In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the family&#x27;s loss of privacy during a national campaign [27] ``The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,&#x27;&#x27; said Mrs [28] Quayle, 39 [29] Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it [30] Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said [31] Benjamin was ambiguous but he thought Secret Service agents might be able to help him on tests at school, Mrs [32] Quayle said [33] Corinne didn&#x27;t like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home, Quayle said [34] ``She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob Dole,&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; said Quayle [35] Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F [36] Kennedy [37] Sen [38] John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak, ``I&#x27;d say, `there stands the next Thomas Jefferson&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; [39] And, added Warner, ``he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia&#x27;&#x27; [40] Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a Democrat [41] ``In 1960, the American people voted for John F [42] Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,&#x27;&#x27; said Ford [43] ``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle&#x27;s had 12 years&#x27;&#x27; [44] What Quayle thinks of those references isn&#x27;t known [45] But he doesn&#x27;t like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert Redford [46] Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder [47] In the parlance of politics, it&#x27;s an issue [48] They are both male [49] They are both blond [50] The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage [51] The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The Candidate&#x27;&#x27; sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature [52] Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself [53] And this week, he told reporters he considered the so-called Redford look ``a stigma&#x27;&#x27; [54] He wasn&#x27;t asked how he felt about being painted as another Jefferson or Kennedy [55] Meanwhile, fellow senators were trying to publicize Quayle who, at 41, hasn&#x27;t had a chance to become a legend [56] He is a Republican vice presidential candidate who is not, as Spiro Agnew once said of himself, a household word [57] To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday took turns telling reporters how much they liked him [58] ``We know him well,&#x27;&#x27; said Strom Thurmond, R-S [59] C [60] ``He&#x27;s attractive because of his looks, he&#x27;s attractive because of his enthusiasm,&#x27;&#x27; said Sen [61] John McCain, R-Ariz [62] ``I think Dan Quayle, although he&#x27;s 41 years of age, he&#x27;s going to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve,&#x27;&#x27; said Sen [63] Pete Domenici, R-N [64] M [65] Oh, yes, he&#x27;s also rich, but the senators said that should not hold him back [66] ``Let&#x27;s not start this business of who&#x27;s wealthy,&#x27;&#x27; Sen [67] Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, R-N [68] Y [69] Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen [70] Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen [71] Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night [72] Thank you [73] Thank you [74] Mr [75] Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States [76] We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle [77] You know, senators get a lot of mail [78] Party leaders more than most [79] And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem [80] Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate sessions had a very special problem [81] She wrote, and I quote: ``I have my second-grade play tonight [82] Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me&#x27;&#x27; [83] I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along, too [84] Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate [85] Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family man [86] And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan&#x27;s vision of America into the law of the land [87] Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution [88] And now he is ready to carry that revolution forward [89] And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign [90] Just let them try [91] Now, I don&#x27;t mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience [92] He&#x27;s got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts [93] And I just don&#x27;t believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House [94] It sounds like a Dukak-eyed idea to me [95] But Dan Quayle&#x27;s got experience, too [96] He&#x27;s already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country [97] That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis _ and he is running for president [98] As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust [99] I am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr [100] Chairman [101] And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen [102] Dick Lugar [103] End Dole Text _ 1 Take Dan Quayle&#x27;s vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight [104] Bush&#x27;s surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket [105] Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration [106] ``Let&#x27;s go on to victory&#x27;&#x27; [107] Quayle exhorted, as the crowd erupted in cheers [108] The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy [109] Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side&#x27;&#x27; [110] The two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois [111] But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened Quayle&#x27;s candidacy just as it was launched [112] Retired Maj [113] Gen [114] Wendell C [115] Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle&#x27;s grandfather, Eugene C [116] Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,&#x27;&#x27; the News reported [117] Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school [118] A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard [119] Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested [120] Quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters&#x27; questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall [121] It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor, rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of John F [122] Kennedy [123] Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech, saying he was proud of the six years he served [124] He also addressed his relative anonymity: ``Many this week have asked, `Who is Dan Quayle&#x27; [125] The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will&#x27;&#x27; [126] Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition [127] Sen [128] Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle&#x27;s name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job [129] ``He&#x27;s already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator [130] That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis, and he is running for president,&#x27;&#x27; Dole said [131] Sen [132] Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the nomination, said Quayle would ``bring vim, vigor and vitality&#x27;&#x27; to the party and would bring ``sparks and voltage to this campaign&#x27;&#x27; [133] Whether Quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen [134] Others, notably Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, found they could not [135] But Quayle, ever upbeat, was determined Thursday night not to be daunted by the prospect [136] ``Miracles do happen,&#x27;&#x27; he told his party [137] Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle&#x27;s official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division&#x27;s chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show [138] The law creating the unit passed April 14, 1971, and took effect July 1 [139] Officials said Quayle served as chief investigator from July until mid-September, when he became administrative assistant to then-Gov [140] Edgar D [141] Whitcomb [142] Quayle&#x27;s Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General&#x27;s office from 1970 to 1971 [143] ``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,&#x27;&#x27; said Robert Smith, the unit&#x27;s first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis [144] ``He was in fact the chief investigator [145] He helped get the unit set up [146] (But) it would not have been before 1971,&#x27;&#x27; Smith said Friday in a telephone interview [147] ``We formally began operations July 1&#x27;&#x27; [148] Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate&#x27;&#x27; and said his staff had written the document [149] ``If it indicated that, that is inaccurate [150] I didn&#x27;t hold that job for two years,&#x27;&#x27; Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane [151] Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap shot&#x27;&#x27; [152] Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General&#x27;s office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard [153] Quayle, a 1969 graduate of DePauw University, was attending Indiana University Law School at the time [154] M [155] Stanton Evans, then an editor with the Indianapolis News, helped arrange his job interview with the state [156] Evans worked for Eugene C [157] Pulliam, Quayle&#x27;s grandfather and publisher of the News [158] ``At no point in any of this did Dan Quayle ask any favors or use any influence,&#x27;&#x27; said Evans, now with the National Journalism Center in Washington, D [159] C [160] ``He wouldn&#x27;t have been hired as a chief investigator [161] He was hired in an entry-level job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits [162] It&#x27;s a nothing story,&#x27;&#x27; Evans said [163] Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy Sendak [164] Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints and inquiries were handled by me [165] The legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was Dan Quayle&#x27;&#x27; [166] Her statement was released by the Quayle campaign [167] The Consumer Protection Division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products, false claims in ads, faulty speedometer readings and mail-order fraud [168] In 1980, Quayle referred to himself as a ``Vietnam-era veteran&#x27;&#x27; in campaign literature when he was running against three-term incumbent Birch Bayh in a Senate race [169] Quayle, who enlisted in the Indiana National Guard, dropped the reference after objections by some Vietnam combat veterans [170] In that same election, which he won, Quayle said he was ``on active duty for several periods during his tenure&#x27;&#x27; in the Guard [171] The statement referred to periods when Quayle was in basic training and 15 days of camp each summer [172] Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside&#x27;&#x27; in George Bush&#x27;s White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say [173] Encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies, Quayle enters a Bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies [174] Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel [175] ``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more [176] One thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown [177] With Quayle, it&#x27;s just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals,&#x27;&#x27; said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the American presidency [178] Bush rarely mentioned his 41-year-old running mate during the campaign [179] When asked, Bush employed the stock lines that Quayle would ``make an outstanding vice president&#x27;&#x27; and had been ``tempered by steel&#x27;&#x27; as he weathered the early furor over his military service, academic record and personal life [180] The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to the president [181] But he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give Quayle [182] Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council, and that he assumes he&#x27;ll have a role in the administration&#x27;s anti-drug efforts [183] ``I will be a very close adviser to the president,&#x27;&#x27; Quayle said [184] But that&#x27;s not the way everyone sees it [185] Both Bush and Mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns, Barilleaux notes [186] ``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign [187] He doesn&#x27;t have his own big reputation on Capitol Hill [188] Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush,&#x27;&#x27; Barilleaux says [189] ``They&#x27;re going to give him a lot of window dressing, a space council, drug task force, but he&#x27;s going to be a man on the outside [190] not a man who&#x27;s going to be consulted in a crisis, except on a pro forma basis&#x27;&#x27; [191] But Eddie Mahe Jr [192] , a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign [193] ``Vindication demands that [194] Both of them will want to prove how right the decision was,&#x27;&#x27; Mahe says [195] Democrats portrayed Quayle during the campaign as a lightweight, a man with little or no legislative accomplishments, untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency [196] Even some members of Quayle&#x27;s own party were dismayed at Bush&#x27;s choice [197] Quayle didn&#x27;t help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I didn&#x27;t live in this century&#x27;&#x27; [198] Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, says Quayle, while ``not the world&#x27;s leading intellectual,&#x27;&#x27; is not ``a complete dummy&#x27;&#x27; [199] He was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared, Ornstein says [200] ``I think he&#x27;s immature [201] He&#x27;s not stupid,&#x27;&#x27; Ornstein says [202] But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging stereotype that&#x27;s developed about him that&#x27;s widely believed in the political community and that&#x27;s believed by a large segment of the electorate,&#x27;&#x27; Ornstein says [203] ``That&#x27;s going to give him a good deal to overcome [204] It&#x27;s going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself [205] That&#x27;s going to be difficult, given the office&#x27;&#x27; [206] Both Barilleaux and Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution see parallels in Quayle&#x27;s vice presidency and those of Richard Nixon and Spiro Agnew [207] The choice of Nixon was viewed as a move by Dwight Eisenhower to appease the party&#x27;s right wing, and Agnew was seen as a political nonentity [208] ``The natural response is to use him (Quayle) sparingly, as Nixon did with Agnew in 1968,&#x27;&#x27; Hess says [209] ``However, Quayle has four years to prove himself, and I think you&#x27;re going to see stories in two years about how much he&#x27;s learned, how much he&#x27;s acted responsibly, how far he&#x27;s come from the campaign of 1988&#x27;&#x27; [210] Quayle admits the campaign was a learning process [211] After the controversies subsided, Quayle declared his independence from his Bush handlers, saying he would be his own man [212] He became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from Washington and to deliver the party&#x27;s scripted message [213] Soon, he dropped off the front pages [214] And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news, he played the role of loyal No [215] 2 and even trumpeted his new anonymity [216] ``We have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all [217] That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re supposed to be,&#x27;&#x27; he told reporters [218] That willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a Bush White House, Mahe feels, since Bush wants ``a private adviser, whose experience and opinion he respected [219] (who) has never had another agenda&#x27;&#x27; [220] ``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone,&#x27;&#x27; Mahe says [221] ``You&#x27;re never going to see Dan Quayle telling tales out of school [222] &#x27;&#x27; One year after his election, Dan Quayle has achieved all he ever wanted: He has become dull [223] His coming-out party last Sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news [224] He went on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; [225] This was no small thing [226] During his entire campaign for the vice presidency, Quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows [227] He didn&#x27;t appear on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; or &quot;This Week With David Brinkley&quot; or &quot;Face the Nation&quot; [228] And he didn&#x27;t do so because back then he was making too much news [229] His every slip, his every gaffe, his every goof was news [230] He was the stuff of nightly TV monologues [231] &quot;A lot of people feel Quayle is just too inexperienced for a do-nothing job,&quot; Jay Leno once said [232] That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn&#x27;t give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn&#x27;t qualified for a job that had no qualifications [233] So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target [234] Stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 1992 [235] &quot;We had asked him on the show a number of times,&quot; Christie Basham, senior producer of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; told me, &quot;but he always declined [236] We renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show, he changed his mind and said he would [237] It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest&quot; [238] And it says something about Dan Quayle&#x27;s reputation that he would be considered &quot;above and beyond&quot; the usual guest [239] Normally, a vice president would not be [240] That&#x27;s because vice presidents don&#x27;t actually do anything [241] They don&#x27;t run departments or make policy [242] They mostly wait for heads of state to expire [243] As George Bush once joked about his duties as vice president: &quot;You die; I fly&quot; [244] But Quayle was considered a hot TV guest because he might screw up [245] He might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the President [246] None of this happened [247] The show was uneventful [248] Quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news [249] Some major newspapers didn&#x27;t even bother to do a story the next day [250] It was everything Quayle had hoped for [251] I asked David Beckwith, his spokesman, why Quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show [252] &quot;Well, he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job,&quot; Beckwith said [253] &quot;He wanted to solidify his relationship with the President and learn the inner workings of the administration&quot; [254] So why go on now [255] &quot;It seemed like a particularly opportune week,&quot; Beckwith said [256] George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev had announced a summit [257] Central America was back in the news [258] And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992 [259] &quot;And Marlin (Fitzwater, Bush&#x27;s spokesman) called and just suggested we do the show,&quot; Beckwith said [260] The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush&#x27;s first major (and some would say only) decision of his presidential campaign [261] He had input from a number of people, but Quayle was George Bush&#x27;s choice [262] Many thought it was a terrible choice, but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow [263] And Bush&#x27;s announcement that Quayle would be his running mate again was Bush&#x27;s way of saying: &quot;I didn&#x27;t screw up the first time [264] I made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right it was, I am making it again&quot; [265] And now was the time for Quayle to go on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and show everybody just how right George Bush had been [266] I asked Beckwith if Quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone [267] &quot;He was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions,&quot; Beckwith said [268] &quot;A lot of the time, you never know what you&#x27;re going to get into [269] Sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious&quot; [270] A typical example of a &quot;non-serious&quot; question often put to Dan Quayle is: &quot;Why does everyone say your wife is smarter than you&quot; [271] But Quayle got no questions like that last week [272] I asked Christie Basham of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; if Quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be [273] &quot;Yes,&quot; Basham said, &quot;but almost all the guests do&quot; [274] Quayle&#x27;s questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker, both of whom stuck to serious questions [275] (If Quayle had been told the questioners were going to be Hunter Thompson and Jimmy Breslin, I have a feeling Quayle might have come down with laryngitis) [276] After the show, Fitzwater called Quayle to express his, and presumably the President&#x27;s, pleasure at how Quayle had handled himself [277] Quayle had said very little and he had said it very well [278] &quot;The very limitations of a vice president&#x27;s role don&#x27;t make him an ideal guest,&quot; Beckwith admitted [279] &quot;Almost by job description, a vice president is not permitted to make serious news&quot; [280] And Quayle knows his future is in sticking to that [281] During the 1988 campaign, I interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle would run for President in 1996 [282] And he will do so, I believe, by being a vice president who keeps his head down, his nose clean and his life dull [283] After all, it worked for George Bush [284] Column He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit [285] To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is, after all, the vice president of the United States [286] &quot;We&#x27;re preserving history,&quot; says David Schenkel, the exhibition coordinator [287] &quot;A century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him [288] &quot;; If so, Huntington will be ready [289] Relatives, former classmates and longtime neighbors of Quayle have donated yearbooks, report cards, poems, letters, his Little League uniform, a coffee cup he drank from, a chair he once stood on during the 1988 presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched, wrote, signed or posed for [290] The vice president&#x27;s mother, Corinne, donated a lock of his baby hair [291] The 1972 Indianapolis 500 queen produced a picture of Quayle, then an aide to Indiana Gov [292] Edgar Whitcomb, accompanying her to the race [293] And a former housekeeper turned in a 20-year-old piece of carpeting she saved from one of Quayle&#x27;s floors [294] The exhibition, which runs through May 20, was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation&#x27;s 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president [295] &quot;He has taken such a bad rap,&quot; said Schenkel, a foundation board member [296] &quot;If people knew him, they&#x27;d see he&#x27;s a regular person [297] If they had a chance to sit down with Dan as a neighbor, they would see the extremely good values in the man [298] &quot;; These are the faithful, who have long since stopped expecting &quot;good press&quot; on their man [299] Instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity, describing the best coverage as &quot;more upbeat&quot; or &quot;halfway decent [300] &quot;; They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 in February (&quot;All he needs is a little seasoning&quot;); his limited experience (&quot;Look at what they said about Truman -- he was a haberdasher&quot;), and his passion for golf (&quot;He has to have some form of relaxation&quot;) [301] But they are careful not to stretch the superlatives [302] The description &quot;nice&quot; comes up a lot [303] &quot;He&#x27;s not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is,&quot; says Dottie Watson, president of the Republican Women of Huntington County [304] &quot;He&#x27;s a very nice person, a capable person [305] Everybody I know says he can do it [306] &quot;; That is not to say some people don&#x27;t have some friendly advice for Quayle [307] &quot;If he would slow down, talk an octave lower and think about what he&#x27;s saying, I don&#x27;t think people would take him the way they do,&quot; said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the owner of Nick&#x27;s Kitchen, Quayle&#x27;s favorite restaurant [308] Hayden Schenkel, chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel, says, &quot;Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States [309] Most of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans would say they&#x27;re tickled to death to have him as vice president, and they&#x27;re 100 percent behind him [310] But in all due respect, we sure hope nothing happens to President Bush [311] &quot;; Quayle has declined an invitation to attend the tribute, citing a busy schedule [312] Nonetheless, most of Huntington&#x27;s 17,000 residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition, which tracks his life from infancy through law school, from the Senate to the vice presidency [313] The free exhibition has turned a gray room in the town&#x27;s public library into a virtual Dan Quayle museum [314] The display patches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikingly ordinary [315] There is Dan Quayle and his brother Chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats, or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at Christmas [316] There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class, Dan Quayle with the high school golf team, Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with Sharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the Fort Wayne Country Club [317] It is all very 50s, very Middle American, almost surreal in its innocence [318] There are windows into the workings of the Quayle family, too [319] For example, his father, James, signed the report cards when Dan brought home poor grades, and his mother signed when he brought home good ones [320] And there are letters and poems that he wrote, which only go to show that one does not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics [321] Dan wrote this rather thoughtful verse on Nov [322] 22, 1960, when he was 13 years old:; My Dad is very very nice; But he is not made of sugar and spice [323] Sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed; But at other times he is as cheerful as a bird [324] The exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaper announcement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle&#x27;s wedding, the wooden &quot;Quayle &amp; Quayle&quot; shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here, and assorted campaign souvenirs, including the official air sickness bag from the 1988 Republican National Convention [325] Ultimately, the foundation wants to build a repository for the memorabilia [326] It has already organized a walking tour of historic Quayle sites, like the white, ranch-style house where he spent his early days, and Nick&#x27;s Kitchen, where he likes to order tenderloins, fries and a milkshake [327] &quot;We want everybody to know he&#x27;s a winner -- I don&#x27;t care what the newspapers say,&quot; said Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizers [328] &quot;What a role model for our children, to know that you can be a normal person, come from a normal family and become vice president of the United States&quot;

                <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">[1] C C Kennedy Sen They are both male They are both blond M Thank you Thank you That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis _ and he is running for president Kennedy Sen That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis, and he is running for president,&#x27;&#x27; Dole said Sen M Wendell C Dan Quayle&#x27;s sister believes the Indiana senator won&#x27;t let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy ``I don&#x27;t think it will be tough on the family,&#x27;&#x27; said Martha Saddler, Quayle&#x27;s sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind ``Since he&#x27;s been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it But he does it and loves it&#x27;&#x27; The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life Dan and Marilyn Quayle met as law students in Indianapolis, married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period ``One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit,&#x27;&#x27; said Indianapolis attorney William R Neale, treasurer of Quayle&#x27;s 1986 re-election campaign ``He&#x27;s the same nice guy he was in law school&#x27;&#x27; Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s Dan Quayle, who grew up in Huntington, graduated from DePauw University, a small liberal arts college in Greencastle, Ind , before going to work in the Indiana attorney general&#x27;s office in 1970 Daniel F Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said he doesn&#x27;t expect Quayle&#x27;s national candidacy to change him ``I think his strength is he&#x27;ll remember who his friends are even after this,&#x27;&#x27; said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle&#x27;s 1986 campaign Friends said the Quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in Washington ``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,&#x27;&#x27; said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute ``It&#x27;s a beautiful family I think they&#x27;ll be a real asset&#x27;&#x27; The couple, who married in 1972, have a 14-year-old son, Tucker; a 12-year-old son, Benjamin; and a 9-year-old daughter, Corinne When they campaign in Indiana, the Quayles often tour in two groups _ the boys riding in parades with Marilyn Quayle and Corinne and her father visiting county fairs ``The kids are nonchalant, normal kids,&#x27;&#x27; said Mrs Saddler ``They take it in stride and play&#x27;&#x27; In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the family&#x27;s loss of privacy during a national campaign ``The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,&#x27;&#x27; said Mrs Quayle, 39 Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it Tucker was fascinated by the idea, Quayle said Benjamin was ambiguous but he thought Secret Service agents might be able to help him on tests at school, Mrs Quayle said Corinne didn&#x27;t like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home, Quayle said ``She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob Dole,&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; said Quayle Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F John Warner of Virginia, who served with Quayle on a Senate subcommittee, told an audience that whenever he heard the Indiana senator speak, ``I&#x27;d say, `there stands the next Thomas Jefferson&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; And, added Warner, ``he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather Thomas Jefferson of Virginia&#x27;&#x27; Former president Gerald Ford made the comparison with Kennedy, a Democrat ``In 1960, the American people voted for John F Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,&#x27;&#x27; said Ford ``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle&#x27;s had 12 years&#x27;&#x27; What Quayle thinks of those references isn&#x27;t known But he doesn&#x27;t like it when people say he looks like movie idol Robert Redford Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder In the parlance of politics, it&#x27;s an issue The so-called resemblance became a point of contention in the 1980 Senate race and Redford took umbrage The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The Candidate&#x27;&#x27; sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself And this week, he told reporters he considered the so-called Redford look ``a stigma&#x27;&#x27; He wasn&#x27;t asked how he felt about being painted as another Jefferson or Kennedy Meanwhile, fellow senators were trying to publicize Quayle who, at 41, hasn&#x27;t had a chance to become a legend He is a Republican vice presidential candidate who is not, as Spiro Agnew once said of himself, a household word To help him get known, eight fellow senators Wednesday took turns telling reporters how much they liked him ``We know him well,&#x27;&#x27; said Strom Thurmond, R-S ``He&#x27;s attractive because of his looks, he&#x27;s attractive because of his enthusiasm,&#x27;&#x27; said Sen John McCain, R-Ariz ``I think Dan Quayle, although he&#x27;s 41 years of age, he&#x27;s going to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve,&#x27;&#x27; said Sen Pete Domenici, R-N Oh, yes, he&#x27;s also rich, but the senators said that should not hold him back ``Let&#x27;s not start this business of who&#x27;s wealthy,&#x27;&#x27; Sen Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, R-N Y Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night Mr Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle You know, senators get a lot of mail Party leaders more than most And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem Well, three years ago, I received a handwritten plea from a 6-year-old girl who after several days of long, long Senate sessions had a very special problem She wrote, and I quote: ``I have my second-grade play tonight Please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me&#x27;&#x27; I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along, too Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate Dan Quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family man And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan&#x27;s vision of America into the law of the land Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution And now he is ready to carry that revolution forward And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign Just let them try Now, I don&#x27;t mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience He&#x27;s got plenty of experience, plenty of experience _ experience in raising taxes again and again, experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools, experience in increasing spending year after year after year in Massachusetts And I just don&#x27;t believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House It sounds like a Dukak-eyed idea to me But Dan Quayle&#x27;s got experience, too He&#x27;s already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust I am honored to nominate him for vice president, Mr Chairman And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen Dick Lugar End Dole Text _ 1 Take Dan Quayle&#x27;s vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight Bush&#x27;s surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration ``Let&#x27;s go on to victory&#x27;&#x27; Quayle exhorted, as the crowd erupted in cheers The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side&#x27;&#x27; The two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through Indiana, Ohio and Illinois But beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened Quayle&#x27;s candidacy just as it was launched Retired Maj Gen Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle&#x27;s grandfather, Eugene C Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,&#x27;&#x27; the News reported Quayle, a hardliner on defense matters, has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard Bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping Quayle from the ticket, as some Republicans suggested Quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters&#x27; questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall It was a daunting change for the senator, whose youthful vigor, rapid political rise, striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of John F Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech, saying he was proud of the six years he served He also addressed his relative anonymity: ``Many this week have asked, `Who is Dan Quayle&#x27; The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will&#x27;&#x27; Those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition Bob Dole of Kansas, who placed Quayle&#x27;s name in nomination, stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job</pre>
