 .By 1991 the chain's sales had risen to nearly Dollars 44bn, making it the world's largest retailer in terms of revenues, and the Walton family probably America's richest.

 'WAL-MART: A HISTORY OF SAM WALTON'S RETAIL PHENOMENON' by Sandra S. Vance and Roy V. Scott Twayne Publishers, New York, Dollars 14.95 240 pages Many people might be said to be the personification of the American Dream; few are better qualified for that title than Sam Walton.
 .Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also has a replica of Sam Walton's original office at the store, including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.
 .District managers hold a conference call with their store managers, and before the day is out, the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads.
 .``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain, based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
 .At the time of its incorporation in 1971, Wal-Mart had only 38 outlets with sales of Dollars 44m - not enough to earn a place in trade journal Discount Merchandiser's list of the 71 biggest US discount retailers.
 .Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it.
 .Manager Don Bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Bentonville, Ark. Chairman Sam Walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the De Soto store.
 .Ten years later, with 330 stores and Dollars 1.6bn sales, it was only the 33rd-biggest retailer in the US.
 .When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans, recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.
 .After serving three years in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store, eventually becoming the company's biggest franchisee.
 .He lost the lease on that one, and relocated to Bentonville.
