A Bush aide said the matter was discussed with the Indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the Bush ticket, and Quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the Guard.
 ."He wanted to solidify his relationship with the President and learn the inner workings of the administration" .


 .The exhibition, which runs through May 20, was put together by the Dan Quayle Commemorative Foundation, a sort of fan-club-turned-archive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nation's 44th and, they say, least-understood vice president.
 .Column

 He is the most important person ever to come out of this town, and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency, Huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the Premiere Dan Quayle Memorabilia Exhibit.
 .To those who say Quayle does not merit his own exhibition, Quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is, after all, the vice president of the United States.
 .``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign.
 .The president-elect told reporters Quayle would have access to the same papers, information and intelligence that is available to the president.
 .And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagan's vision of America into the law of the land.
 .Retired Maj.
 Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,'' the News reported.
 .The actor, who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in ``The Candidate'' sent Quayle a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his congressional campaign literature.
 .The exhibit also includes the 1972 newspaper announcement of Dan and Marilyn Quayle's wedding, the wooden "Quayle & Quayle" shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here, and assorted campaign souvenirs, including the official air sickness bag from the 1988 Republican National Convention.
 .The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.
 .Quayle alluded to the National Guard issue during his speech, saying he was proud of the six years he served.
 .``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,'' said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute.
 .Quayle said the news media had made the comparison, not he, and after he was elected sent Redford an autographed picture of himself.
 .We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
 .It was the 42nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest" .


 .And now was the time for Quayle to go on "Meet the Press" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been .


 .``He was assigned to our section in the spring of 1971,'' said Robert Smith, the unit's first director and now an attorney in Indianapolis.
 .Theodore Sendak, the Attorney General at the time, recently had surgery and is unable to comment, according to his son, Timothy Sendak.
 Patricia Gifford, a Marion Superior Court judge who was then an assistant attorney general, said Friday that prior to the establishment of the Consumer Protection Division, ``all complaints and inquiries were handled by me.
 .``In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,'' said Ford.
 .With Quayle, it's just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals,'' said Ryan Barilleaux, a professor of political science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, who studies the American presidency.
 .Though he found himself in danger of fizzling Thursday, Quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family, generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a Bush administration.
 ."He's not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is," says Dottie Watson, president of the Republican Women of Huntington County.
 .Whether, indeed, he looks like Redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder.
 .But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign.
 .Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming, one of those who seconded the nomination, said Quayle would ``bring vim, vigor and vitality'' to the party and would bring ``sparks and voltage to this campaign''.
 .He became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from Washington and to deliver the party's scripted message.
 .``The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,'' said Mrs. Quayle, 39.
 ."; They defend the relatively young age of Quayle, who turned 44 in February ("All he needs is a little seasoning"); his limited experience ("Look at what they said about Truman -- he was a haberdasher"), and his passion for golf ("He has to have some form of relaxation").
 ."Well, he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job," Beckwith said.
 ."He was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions," Beckwith said.
 .Mr. Chairman, four of my congressional colleagues and I are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the United States.
 .He's already spent 12 years as a congressman and a senator, tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all Americans and the future of our country.
 .Most of the Democrats and even some of the Republicans would say they're tickled to death to have him as vice president, and they're 100 percent behind him.
 .Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.
 .Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel.
 .After the show, Fitzwater called Quayle to express his, and presumably the President's, pleasure at how Quayle had handled himself .


 .Quayle didn't help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign, perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the Holocaust and his declaration, ``I didn't live in this century''.
 .Bush's surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration, but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the Republicans by withdrawing from the ticket.
 .Quayle conceded Friday that the resume entry was ``inaccurate'' and said his staff had written the document.
 .Whether it was the budget or defense, tax reform or the INF treaty, Dan Quayle was there, a forceful advocate, and a staunch supporter of the Reagan revolution.
 .And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen. Dick Lugar .


 .The 41-year-old nominee delivered the speech with calm self-assurance, sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks _ perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy.
 .The people of Indiana know me and now the nation will''.
 .Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side''.
 .Quayle was hired as an entry-level research assistant by the state Attorney General's office in 1970 after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the Indiana National Guard.
 .That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didn't give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasn't qualified for a job that had no qualifications .


 .And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.
 .But Quayle comes to the White House with ``a very damaging stereotype that's developed about him that's widely believed in the political community and that's believed by a large segment of the electorate,'' Ornstein says.
 .Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.
 .There are windows into the workings of the Quayle family, too.
 .There is Dan Quayle with his Vacation Bible School class, Dan Quayle with the high school golf team, Dan Quayle at 5 or 6 years of age with Sharon McEachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the Fort Wayne Country Club.
 .Quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters' questions about the topic during a brief walk-through at the convention hall.
 .Earlier, however, Quayle spokesman David Prosperi called the revelation of the error by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland ``a cheap shot''.
 .In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the family's loss of privacy during a national campaign.
 .Quayle's questioners were David Broder of the Washington Post and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker, both of whom stuck to serious questions.
