<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>``We know him well,'' said Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
 ``He's attractive because of his looks, he's attractive because of his enthusiasm,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
 ``I think Dan Quayle, although he's 41 years of age, he's going to send a message to the American people that the Republican Party respects young people who achieve,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.
 Oh, yes, he's also rich, but the senators said that should not hold him back.
  </p><p>And now was the time for Quayle to go on "Meet the Press" and show everybody just how right George Bush had been .


  </p><p>Dan Quayle has no friends in a Bush White House except George Bush,'' Barilleaux says.
  </p><p>The selection of Dan Quayle had been Bush's first major (and some would say only) decision of his presidential campaign.
  </p><p>That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis, and he is running for president,'' Dole said.
  </p><p>Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle's official resume says he was the Indiana Consumer Protection Division's chief investigator a year before the unit was created, state records show.
  </p><p>The Quayle family and friends were celebrating Tuesday afternoon after George Bush announced he wants the 41-year-old Indiana senator to be the Republican nominee for vice president.
  </p><p>``John Kennedy had been in the House and Senate 14 years before he was elected president and Dan Quayle's had 12 years''.
  </p><p>Quayle had said very little and he had said it very well .


  </p><p>And, oh yeah, Bush had said Dan Quayle would be on the ticket in 1992 .


  </p><p>``Dan Quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more.
  </p><p>Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas nominating Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana for vice president at the Republican National Convention on Thursday night.
  </p><p>As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust.
  </p><p>But Dan Quayle's got experience, too.
  </p><p> Dan Quayle's sister believes the Indiana senator won't let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife, Marilyn, enjoy.
  </p><p>Daniel F. Evans, also a law school classmate of Dan Quayle, said he doesn't expect Quayle's national candidacy to change him.
  </p><p>``In 1960, the American people voted for John F. Kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as Dan Quayle,'' said Ford.
  </p><p>``Dan Quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone,'' Mahe says.
  </p><p>``However, Quayle has four years to prove himself, and I think you're going to see stories in two years about how much he's learned, how much he's acted responsibly, how far he's come from the campaign of 1988''.
  </p><p>But Eddie Mahe Jr., a GOP consultant who worked with the Bush campaign, says Bush is likely to give Quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign.
  </p><p>"Almost by job description, a vice president is not permitted to make serious news" .


  </p><p>Dan Quayle is likely to be a ``man on the outside'' in George Bush's White House following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity, experts say.
  </p><p>In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the family's loss of privacy during a national campaign.
  </p><p>And it says something about Dan Quayle's reputation that he would be considered "above and beyond" the usual guest.
  </p><p>I asked David Beckwith, his spokesman, why Quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show .


  </p><p>We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
  </p><p>``Dan Quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the Bush campaign.
  </p><p>Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel.
  </p><p>And Bush's announcement that Quayle would be his running mate again was Bush's way of saying: "I didn't screw up the first time.
  </p><p>During the 1988 campaign, I interviewed Quayle and I came away with one overwhelming impression: Dan Quayle would run for President in 1996 .


  </p><p>Corinne and her brothers, Tucker and Benjamin, and their mother, Marilyn, share Dan Quayle with the people of Indiana and the United States Senate.
  </p><p>``I will be a very close adviser to the president,'' Quayle said.
  </p><p>``I don't think it will be tough on the family,'' said Martha Saddler, Quayle's sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind.
 ``Since he's been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it.
  </p><p>"If he would slow down, talk an octave lower and think about what he's saying, I don't think people would take him the way they do," said Jean Anne Drabenstot, the owner of Nick's Kitchen, Quayle's favorite restaurant.
  </p><p>I didn't hold that job for two years,'' Quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane.
  </p><p>Normally, a vice president would not be.
  </p><p>Corinne didn't like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home, Quayle said.
  </p><p>``His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to,'' said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute.
  </p><p>But he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give Quayle.
  </p><p>Dan Quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already Republicans are comparing him to Thomas Jefferson and John F. Kennedy.
  </p><p>"What a role model for our children, to know that you can be a normal person, come from a normal family and become vice president of the United States" .


  </p><p>Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.
  </p><p>``She told me, `Daddy, I really hope George Bush picks Bob Dole,''' said Quayle .
  </p><p>Bush, who followed his running mate to the podium, said he was ``proud to have Dan Quayle at my side''.
  </p><p>But Quayle got no questions like that last week.
  </p><p>Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life.
  </p><p>Quayle's Senate biography, which his campaign is using as his official background, says he was chief investigator of the unit in the Attorney General's office from 1970 to 1971.
  </p><p>Hayden Schenkel, chairman of the Huntington County Democratic Party and a distant cousin of David Schenkel, says, "Some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the United States.
  </p><p>``I think his strength is he'll remember who his friends are even after this,'' said Evans, who was chairman of Quayle's 1986 campaign.
  </p><p>And I just don't believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.
  </p><p>Retired Maj.
 Gen. Wendell C. Phillippi _ who worked for Quayle's grandfather, Eugene C. Pulliam, as managing editor of The Indianapolis News _ said he contacted the National Guard on behalf of Quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and ``recommended him very highly,'' the News reported.
  </p><p>"We want everybody to know he's a winner -- I don't care what the newspapers say," said Marge Hiner, one of the exhibit organizers.
  </p><p>And there are letters and poems that he wrote, which only go to show that one does not have to be a Yeats to make it in politics.
  </p><p>``You're never going to see Dan Quayle telling tales out of school.''

  </p><p>Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.
  </p><p>Take
 Dan Quayle's vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young Indiana senator, but the dream faded overnight.
  </p><p>That is 12 more years of national experience than Michael Dukakis _ </p></body>
