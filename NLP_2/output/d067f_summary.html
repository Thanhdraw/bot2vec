 .The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country.

 .The stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern Florida, the area hit worst by the hurricane, all took a tumble.

 DAMAGE CAUSED by Hurricane Andrew could rise to Dollars 20bn, it was estimated yesterday, as one of the costliest US storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of New Orleans.
 .Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located.
 .Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, said: 'On the basis of emerging information, General Accident advise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed'.
 .Most of the storm's fury was spent against sparsely populated farming communities and swampland in the state, sparing it the widespread destruction caused in Florida, where 15 people died.
 .The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters.
 .The US industry's Property Claims Service, the official compiler of disaster losses, had yet to compile a preliminary tally of the Florida bill.
 .Not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have been estimates that the storm caused more than Dollars 20bn of damage.
 .Moreover, the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction - down.
 .The dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week, and the devastating effect of Hurricane Andrew produced a typically hard-eyed, although nonetheless logical, reaction from Wall Street.
 .On Wall Street, most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago Friday and on the following Monday, when bond yields jumped sharply and the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more than 75 points.
 .Although there is not much chance, given the present economic and political climate, that the Fed will raise rates to help the dollar, there is little doubt that the currency's weakness makes it extremely difficult for the Fed to ease monetary policy again.
 .The dollar put paid to those hopes and, by the middle of this week, it was approaching 7.45 per cent, putting an upward pressure on the all-important mortgage rate for home-buyers.
 .The town of Homestead, near the centre of the storm, was largely flattened, including a local air force base.
 .The fear that the Fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets.
 .The government estimated it would cost Dollars 20bn-Dollars 30bn to tidy and rebuild in Florida, and to care for residents displaced by the storm.
