<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany -- who would presumably be allowed to vote in December -- could easily tip the balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government leadership .

 The mass emigration of thousands of disaffected East Germans has rekindled reunification talk in West Germany, where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two Germanys.
  </p><p>He said he agreed with Gorbachev that reunification must be decided not only by East and West Germany, but all of Europe.
  </p><p>The West German constitution calls for a united Germany, but it has not been a paramount concern of the West Germans in the years since the ruins of Nazi Germany were divided into East and West at the end of World War II.
  </p><p>West German officials and media today praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for softening his view on German reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened East Germans.
  </p><p>His meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev convinced him, he told West German radio, that the two German states should "enter into negotiations as quickly as possible" after the March 18 East German election .


  </p><p>He was one of several experts in German history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision Tuesday by the four World War II allies _ the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ to accept the reunification of a Germany they divided 45 years ago.
  </p><p>Gorbachev said Tuesday in Moscow that he believed one Germany was likely in the future, but he added that Germans ``should not decide this important question on the streets''.
  </p><p>About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
  </p><p>Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an "economic breakthrough" in East Germany, which in turn could provide a "push forward" for all of Europe .


  </p><p>Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a ``procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe'' and that the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.
  </p><p>According to Tass, the Soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either East or West Germany, the four Allied powers: France, Britain, the United States or the Soviet Union, or anyone else in Europe.
  </p><p>As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
  </p><p>Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a ``sorrowful state'' and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
  </p><p>He also said German reunification is unlikely as long as West Germany belongs to NATO and East Germany to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact military alliance .
  </p><p>There is growing discussion in West Germany about German reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in East Germany.
  </p><p>He said the sessions, which will include government officials and outside experts, hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with West Germany's Western allies, particularly the U.S.
 "It has become clear to the world that the Communist system in East Germany is in trouble," Mr. Lintner said.
  </p><p>A different approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire European process, including the relations between the two German states,'' Gorbachev said.
  </p><p>He said German reunification ``cannot go ahead'' of the reunification of Europe.
  </p><p>He visited the Berlin Wall and met with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and East German Premier Hans Modrow.
  </p><p>Also Saturday, more than 100 East Germans protested in front of the Soviet Embassy in East Berlin against the stationing of Soviet helicopters in their country, ADN said.
  </p><p>Since West Germany and East Germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances, any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from Washington and Moscow.
  </p><p>President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met Tuesday with East German Premier Hans Modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual German reunification.
  </p><p>Skubiszewski faulted West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's program for gradual German reunification, offered last week, for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between Poland and East Germany.
  </p><p>Sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in East Germany in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests, spurring talk of reuniting the two German states divided at the end of World War II.
  </p><p>In the Solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue, Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski told Parliament the two German states could be joined as part of the process of uniting Europe.
  </p><p>Gorbachev inquired about plans by West German politicians to campaign in East Germany, Kohl said, adding that the Soviet leader did not appear to be upset about such political activity .


  </p><p>Kohl will meet with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation, including monetary union, to prevent the collapse of the faltering East German economy .


  </p><p>``Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must take place in peace and freedom,'' he said.
  </p><p>``It may also mean the end of Western European unity, because both have been based on a divided Germany and a divided Europe,'' Hyland says.
  </p><p>As the western German population is now aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans' living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish.
  </p><p>Soviets say the question of German reunification is to be decided in the future.
  </p><p>East German Communists on Tuesday endorsed for reunification for the first time.
  </p><p>Unconfirmed West German intelligence reports appearing in the West German media said Moscow fears a growing dissident movement and mass demonstrations in East Germany by next year.
  </p><p>While the people of West Europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts, East Europeans, living in closed societies, have not, he said, and fear of Germany is a reality in East Europe and Russia, he said.
  </p><p>Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, during a Central Committee in Moscow on Saturday, urged the West not to try to influence developments in East Germany.
  </p><p>ADN said Gorbachev would meet soon with Gregor Gysi, a reformer who was chosen East German Communist Party chief on Saturday.
  </p><p>Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the Warsaw Pact.
  </p><p>The chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in East Germany now support reunification.
  </p><p>But Soviet affairs expert William Hyland says that despite these assertions, a reunified Germany is ``really terrifying to most of the countries involved, to the West Germans, to the United States, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia.
  </p><p>Calls for German reunification have increased since the ouster of the hard-line Communist leadership and the opening of East Germany's borders during the fall pro-democracy movement.
  </p><p>The West German leader advocates a reunified Germany that would respect the security needs _ and borders _ of the rest of Europe.
  </p><p>West Germany has proposed a plan for greater unity, but East German leaders reject reunification.
  </p><p>``If East Germany stays in the Warsaw Pact, NATO, with the best of its ability, would try to prevent full reunification; maybe a confederation between the two Germanys, but not a full reunification,'' Rogers says.
  </p><p>Count Otto Lambsdorff, head of West Germany's Free Democratic Party, a partner in the governing coalition, said Tuesday in London that Gorbachev has adopted ``a more positive attitude'' toward German reunification.
  </p><p>``I must tell you I am not among those in the cheering section applauding the rush towards German reunification,'' Rabbi Marvin Hier wrote Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Prime Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany.
  </p><p>Historians say the world need not fear that German jackboots will echo again on European pavements, but some still see the rush toward German reunification as a setback _ </p><p>As much of Western Europe heads towards its own unification in 1992, the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the German side with a powerhouse of nearly 80 million people _ 61.1 million West Germans and 16.6 million East Germans.
  </p><p>``The East German state is collapsing,'' said Geyer.
  </p><p>Asked how soon the two Germanys could merge, Kohl declared that the March election has to come first, and "then I think it will all go very quickly" .


  </p><p>Ever since reunification became a blazing issue, Kohl's standing in West German opinion polls has risen, and if the national elections, now scheduled for December, were held today, he would have a good chance of leading his Christian Democratic Union to victory .


  </p><p> Three decades ago, a West German politician said German reunification was a ``sleeping lioness'' that would awake one day with a mighty roar.
  </p><p>In West Germany, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told West German Radio that Gorbachev had ``correctly analyzed'' the situation and again shown his political skill.
  </p><p>West Germany is already Europe's largest exporting nation, and despite its many flaws East Germany's economy is the envy of many Soviet bloc neighbors.
  </p><p>The rallies came shortly after the four victorious World War II Allies met in West Berlin to discuss the latest developments in East Germany and Berlin _ the divided city that they still technically administer.
  </p><p>West Germans were aware of their European neighbors' misgivings, said Richard Breitman of American University, and so they presented reunification within the context of European integration.
  </p><p>``If there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), certainly 80 percent to 90 percent would vote for national reunification with the Federal Republic of Germany,'' added the 44-year-old Lintner in an Associated Press interview.
  </p><p>The Soviet Union couldn't afford to have a reunited Germany as part of the Western Alliance.
  </p><p>``West Germany withdraws from NATO; and a referendum in both East and West Germany votes for reunification and neutrality''.
  </p><p>``If the situation has changed, the East German government must say so,'' said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for establishment of a common currency for the two states.
  </p><p>The Soviet Union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of German reunification, but Gorbachev has softened that position in adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.
  </p><p>The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
  </p><p>Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit.
  </p><p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
  </p><p>Since East Germans began agitating for an end to Communist domination two months ago, public pressure has forced the opening of the Berlin Wall and pushed the Communists to promise free elections and relinquish their political monopoly .
  </p><p>The chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center has asked to meet with the leaders of West and East Germany to discuss ``the great fear that German reunification brings to the community of victims of Nazism''.
