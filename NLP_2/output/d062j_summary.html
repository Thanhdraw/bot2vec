The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it.
 .But it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience -- the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality.
 .State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest home and auto insurer in California, believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $475 million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from Hurricane Hugo.
 .in Sacramento said that in the San Francisco area roughly 25 to 30 percent of the homes have earthquake insurance.
 .Indeed, the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways.
 ."We are saying this is the breaking point, this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace," said William Yankus, an analyst with Conning & Co., a Hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry.
 .Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.
 .Industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated $4 billion in damages from Hurricane Hugo, which hammered South Carolina and other parts of the southeastern United States earlier this month.
 .Instead, even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks, analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear.
 .Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.
 .The scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge .


 .Insurers aren't required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said.
 .In the aftermath of the California earthquake, President Bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning.
 .Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.
 .But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.
 .However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.
 .Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill.
 Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages they're likely to have to pay.
 .While the Department of Transportation and the state Transportation Commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds, the governor also sets general state priorities .


 .EARTHQUAKES -- SAN FRANCISCO; EARTHQUAKES -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA; OAKLAND (CA); DISASTER VICTIMS


 Gov. George Deukmejian is right to call the Legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last Tuesday's Northern California earthquake.
 .The governor's answer, which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake, was that no one in Caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake.
 .Existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the Office of Emergency Services for allocation to local governments.
 .The governor and legislative leaders will meet again next Monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session.
 .The major reason is so that California can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake.
